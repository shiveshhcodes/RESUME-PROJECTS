# Resume-Projects

This repository serves as a comprehensive showcase of all the projects I've worked on, highlighting my technical skills and experience in various domains, including frontend development, Python, and more. Each project is organized into distinct folders with relevant documentation to make it easier to navigate through my work. This repository acts as an extension of my resume, allowing potential employers or collaborators to explore my code, solutions, and contributions.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured to separate different types of projects and related files, ensuring clarity and ease of access:


### 1. **Frontend Projects**
   The **Frontend Projects** folder contains projects that focus on building user interfaces and web applications using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React. Each project is documented in its respective folder, and you will find additional instructions on setup, deployment, and features.

   Example projects:
   - Personal Portfolio Website
   - React-based interactive applications

### 2. **PYTHON**
   This section includes various Python projects, showcasing my expertise in automation, web development, or small applications written in Python. Each project folder has a separate `README` to explain the functionality, usage, and installation steps.

   Example projects:
   - Shop Management System using Python
   - Python-based automation scripts

### 3. **EXTRA FILES**
   This folder contains supplementary files, which could include additional assets, data, or documentation related to my projects. These files are integral for understanding how certain aspects of my projects were built or executed.

### 4. **.gitattributes**
   A file that configures how certain files are treated in Git, ensuring that cross-platform compatibility issues are minimized.

### 5. **.DS_Store**
   This is a system file generated by macOS, and it does not impact the project functionality. It can be safely ignored.
