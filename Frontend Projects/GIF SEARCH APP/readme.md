## Project Title
GIF Search Application

## Description
The GIF Search App is a simple web application that allows users to search for GIFs from the Giphy API based on a search query. The app retrieves GIFs in real-time, displays them in a responsive grid layout, and provides users with the option to download any GIF directly. The project demonstrates the use of JavaScript to fetch data from an API and dynamically display content on a webpage.
