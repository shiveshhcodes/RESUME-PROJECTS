## Project Title
GIF Search Application

## Description
The GIF Search App is a simple web application that allows users to search for GIFs from the Giphy API based on a search query. The app retrieves GIFs in real-time, displays them in a responsive grid layout, and provides users with the option to download any GIF directly.
